# Age of Empires 4 - TypeScript to Lua
Very experimental project to allow writing TypeScript for Age of Empires 4 modding using [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/).

The type definitions are partially autogenerated from the scardocs contained in the AOE4 directory. The rest are either automatically obtained from [this older template](https://github.com/aoemods/aoe4-scenario-template) or added by hand.

It is likely you will need to change some of the definitions because they are not very accurate. Almost all functions also only have `any` for return type since the scardocs don't tell the return type.

## Setup
- Change the `outPath` in `deploy.js` to your own project directory

## Usage
- `npm run build`: Converts the scripts in `scripts/` to a single Lua file
- `npm run dev`: Automatically converts the scripts in `scripts/` to a single Lua file whenever any scripts change
- `npm run deploy <scar directory>`: Copies the Lua file to the project directory and does some necessary post-processing, scar directory is eg. `C:\Users\username\Documents\projectname\assets\scar`
